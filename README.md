# Virtual-channels

Consider the following scenario. Alice and Charlie enter into a contract with a single intermediary Bob. Alice locks up amount **a<sub>0</sub>**, similarily, Charlie locks up collateral **c<sub>0</sub>**. The total channel   with a total collateral then, **k = a<sub>0</sub> + c<sub>0</sub>**. Bob, the intermediary, offers to lock up funds equal to (**b<sub>0</sub> = k**) in exchange for some specified reteurn **r**. This results in a single direction payment chanel between Alice and Charlie with intermediary Bob.
